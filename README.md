LOG:
--- October 7th, 2021 ---
- Installed scipy
- Started running in to the same Pandas error as I experienced in investment_updater app, where pandas threw a "TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'float'" error. SOLUTION ATTEMPTED: installed a bunch of earlier versions of libraries used (most importantly pandas 0.25.3).

--- October 6th, 2021 ---
- Finished the first algorithmic trading project 'Building an Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund'.
- Translated (copy pasted) it in to a regular python script.

--- October 5th, 2021 ---
- Installed Jupyter, requests, xlsxwriter (Numpy + Pandas previously installed) 

--- October 4th, 2021 ---
- Abandoned datacamp course for now because there are too many paid links. Found a Freecodecamp tutorial on youtube that seems suitable and practical.

--- September 26th, 2021 ---
- Initialized project, created .venv etc.
- Found datacamp.com course on algorithmic trading with Python.
- Turns out these courses are paid.
- Installed pandas + pandas-datareader packages
