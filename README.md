LOG:

- Abandoned datacamp course for now because there are too many paid links. Found a Freecodecamp tutorial on youtube that seems suitable and practical.

--- September 26th, 2021 ---
- Initialized project, created .venv etc.
- Found datacamp.com course on algorithmic trading with Python.
- Turns out these courses are paid.
